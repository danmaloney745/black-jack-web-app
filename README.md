You are working for an online casino and your brief is to create a brand new game. The game will be blackjack and must follow all the standard rules of the game.

There must be a way for customers to create an account, login and add money to thair game wallet. Once the customer has money in their wallet they should be able to place bets and the system will update their account balance accordingly.

The user should be able to withdraw funds if they decide to cash out.

The GUI squad is responsible for building the game logic and the front end, including design. You should ensure your front end code is functionally tested.
